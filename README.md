# Flow3D
Flow3D is a 3D voxel game based on [Flow Free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_Free).
Flow Free is a puzzle game where you have to connect colored nodes to each other with pipes within a grid. The goal is to connect each pair of nodes, and take up each square.
Flow3D is the same thing, but with a whole new dimension!
Flow3D was made by Kaushik A., Kevin C., Stanley S., and Peter S. in Java.
