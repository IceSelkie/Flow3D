# Flow3D
Flow3D is a 3D voxel game based on [Flow Free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_Free).

Flow Free is a puzzle game where you have to connect colored nodes to each other with pipes within a grid. The goal is to connect each pair of nodes, and take up each square.

Flow3D is the same thing, but with a third dimension!

Flow3D was made by Kaushik A., Kevin C., Stanley S., and Peter S. in Java 1.8.

This is our AP Computer Science project (and final). The goal is to create a creative, medium sized program that is requires teamwork to give an experience similar to that of professional code development, including documentation. We were graded on: Code, Documentation, Originality, and Quality. Our final score was 380/400.
