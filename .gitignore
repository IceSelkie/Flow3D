# .gitignore
# Git-Ignore tells git, which files to ignore by default.
# This tells git to ignore the files that are custom to local machines, or are generated files.
# These clog up the repository, and won't help anyone.

# Format of lines: Any pattern that matches a line will be ignored.
# Any line that begins with a '#' is ignored.
# Lines that begin with '!' will be added again (if parent folder not ignored)
# To specify a folder, end the line with a '/'.
# The '*' represents any number of any character.

# Any .class file is ignored. (BlueJ's local "compiled" file)
*.class
# Any .ctxt file is ignored. (BlueJ's class datafile that keeps track of comments, javadocs, and other metadata)
*.ctxt
# Uh, there was one of these. I have no idea what it does, or what it does. It also acted weird in other ways.
*.java~
# Generated documentation can change between builds. No need to be in the repository.

# Don't need the BlueJ project being updated and changed all the time.

# This doesnt need to be updated all the time either.
